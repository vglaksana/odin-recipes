    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Steak is marinated in the fridge for 45-minutes, then quickly pan-seared in a cast iron skillet before it is finished in the oven.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil </li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
    </ol>
