    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mashed potato cakes have been a staple in my southern family all throughout my childhood. I came up with this recipe when trying to put a new spin on an old favorite.</p>
    <h4>Ingredient</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded American cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 dash hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, reserving bacon grease in skillet; crumble bacon.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Melt butter in bacon grease over medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and garlic until tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Transfer vegetables and bacon to large bowl; stir in mashed potatoes, American cheese, flour, egg, mustard, black pepper, and hot sauce.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Heat vegetable oil in a clean skillet over medium heat. Drop spoonfuls of mashed potato mixture, flattening slightly, and fry patties until golden brown on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve with sour cream.</p>
    </ol>
